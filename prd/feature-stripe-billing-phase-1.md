### Summary of changes since last update

Created `.env.example` with all placeholder environment variables needed for Phase 1 (Clerk, Neon, Stripe, Resend, App URL). Created `.env.local` as an empty copy of the template — it is gitignored and will NOT be committed. The founder must paste real values from each service's dashboard before running the app locally.

### Detail of changes made:

- Created `.env.example` (tracked) with placeholder vars for: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRICE_PACK_10/20/50/100`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- Created `.env.local` (gitignored, NOT committed) as a blank-values copy of `.env.example` — confirmed ignored by `.gitignore` line 22 rule `.env*.local`

### Potential concerns to address:

- Real values must be filled in `.env.local` after external setup tasks complete: Clerk (B1), Neon (D1), Stripe (H1), Resend (E1). App will not start until at minimum `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL` are set.
- Stripe price IDs (`STRIPE_PRICE_PACK_*`) will only be known after creating products in the Stripe dashboard (task H1) — leave blank until then.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 02:45 PM PDT

### Summary of changes since last update

Installed all runtime and dev dependencies needed for Phase 1 billing: Clerk for auth, Stripe for payments, Drizzle ORM + Neon for the database, Resend for transactional email, drizzle-kit for migrations, Vitest for tests, and @types/node for TypeScript compatibility.

### Detail of changes made:

- Installed runtime: @clerk/nextjs@6.39.3, stripe@17.7.0, drizzle-orm@0.36.4, @neondatabase/serverless@0.10.4, resend@4.8.0
- Installed dev: drizzle-kit@0.30.6, vitest@2.1.9, @types/node@22.19.17
- All versions satisfy the spec'd caret ranges; no divergences

### Potential concerns to address:

- `npm audit` reports 11 moderate + 1 high vulnerability (present before and after install — no net increase from our deps). Should be reviewed before production launch but does not block development.
- Clerk SDK is at v6 which uses the new async `auth()` pattern; webhook handler in the plan uses `await auth()` correctly so no API mismatch expected.
- Two deprecated transitive deps from drizzle-kit (`@esbuild-kit/esm-loader`, `@esbuild-kit/core-utils`) — dev-only, no runtime impact.
